### What is SAFE Server?

- [Secure Access For Everyone (SAFE)](https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/SAFE), is an integrated system for managing trust using a logic-based declarative language. Logical trust systems authorize each request by constructing a proof from a context â€” a set of authenticated logic statements representing credentials and policies issued by various principals in a networked system.
